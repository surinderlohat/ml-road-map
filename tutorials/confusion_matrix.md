A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It is particularly useful for binary and multi-class classification problems. The matrix compares the actual target values with those predicted by the model, and it provides a more detailed breakdown of the performance than a simple accuracy metric.

Here's the structure of a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem:

|                 | Predicted Positive (1) | Predicted Negative (0) |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Actual Positive (1)** | True Positive (TP)         | False Negative (FN)        |
| **Actual Negative (0)** | False Positive (FP)        | True Negative (TN)         |

### Definitions
- **True Positive (TP):** The number of positive instances correctly predicted by the model.
- **False Positive (FP):** The number of negative instances incorrectly predicted as positive by the model.
- **False Negative (FN):** The number of positive instances incorrectly predicted as negative by the model.
- **True Negative (TN):** The number of negative instances correctly predicted by the model.

### Metrics Derived from the Confusion Matrix
Using the values from the confusion matrix, you can calculate several important performance metrics:

1. **Accuracy:** 
   \[
   \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}
   \]
2. **Precision (Positive Predictive Value):** 
   \[
   \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
   \]
3. **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):** 
   \[
   \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
   \]
4. **F1 Score:** 
   \[
   F1 \text{ Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
   \]
5. **Specificity (True Negative Rate):** 
   \[
   \text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
   \]

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the classifier's performance, helping to understand not only its accuracy but also its precision, recall, and ability to avoid false positives and false negatives.
