### Hypothesis in regression
The line draw by the liner regression is called the hypothesis 
i.e we provide X value and it gives the the value of Y

 x = input features
 y = predictions

formula to draw a line
 ``y =mx +c
 y =2x +1``

 ### Cost function
 const function is used to determine how much accurate is our result.
 const referred to as the loss function, measures the performance of a model by quantifying the difference between the predicted values and the actual values

 help us to minimize the difference between predicted value and the actual value 
 formula
 minimize (h0 (x)-y)power2

 ### Gradient Descent
