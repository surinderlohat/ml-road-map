### Hypothesis in regression
The line draw by the liner regression is called the hypothesis 
i.e we provide X value and it gives the the value of Y

 x = input features
 y = predictions

formula to draw a line
 ``y =mx +c
 y =2x +1``

 ### Cost function
 const function is used to determine how much accurate is our result.

 help us to minimize the difference between predicted value and the actual value 
 formula
 minimize (h0 (x)-y)power2
