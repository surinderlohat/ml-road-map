The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the observed actual outcomes and the predicted outcomes. It is used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. The formula for MSE is given by:

\[ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of observations.
- \( y_i \) is the actual value for the \( i \)-th observation.
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value for the \( i \)-th observation.

### Steps to Calculate MSE

1. **Calculate the residuals (errors)**: Subtract the predicted values from the actual values.
\[ \text{Residual}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i \]

2. **Square each residual**: Square the difference obtained in the first step.
\[ (\text{Residual}_i)^2 = (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

3. **Sum the squared residuals**: Add all the squared differences together.
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

4. **Divide by the number of observations**: Calculate the average of the squared residuals by dividing by the number of observations.
\[ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

### Example Calculation

Suppose you have the following actual and predicted values:

| Actual (\( y_i \)) | Predicted (\( \hat{y}_i \)) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 3                  | 2.5                         |
| 5                  | 4.8                         |
| 2                  | 2.2                         |
| 7                  | 6.8                         |
| 4                  | 3.6                         |

1. Calculate the residuals:
   - \( 3 - 2.5 = 0.5 \)
   - \( 5 - 4.8 = 0.2 \)
   - \( 2 - 2.2 = -0.2 \)
   - \( 7 - 6.8 = 0.2 \)
   - \( 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 \)

2. Square each residual:
   - \( 0.5^2 = 0.25 \)
   - \( 0.2^2 = 0.04 \)
   - \( (-0.2)^2 = 0.04 \)
   - \( 0.2^2 = 0.04 \)
   - \( 0.4^2 = 0.16 \)

3. Sum the squared residuals:
   \[ 0.25 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.53 \]

4. Divide by the number of observations (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[ \text{MSE} = \frac{0.53}{5} = 0.106 \]

The Mean Squared Error for this example is 0.106.
