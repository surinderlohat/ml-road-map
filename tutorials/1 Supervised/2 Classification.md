Here are some examples of machine learning classification tasks:

1. **Binary Classification**:
   - **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam (ham).
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining if a movie review is positive or negative.
   - **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraudulent transactions in financial systems.
   - **Cancer Detection**: Classifying medical images or patient data as cancerous or non-cancerous.

2. **Multi-Class Classification**:
   - **Image Classification**: Classifying images into multiple categories (e.g., types of animals, vehicles, etc.).
   - **Document Classification**: Categorizing documents into predefined topics (e.g., news articles into politics, sports, entertainment).
   - **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Recognizing digits from 0 to 9 from handwritten samples (e.g., the MNIST dataset).

3. **Multi-Label Classification**:
   - **Text Classification**: Assigning multiple tags or categories to a single text document (e.g., a blog post tagged with "technology," "AI," and "innovation").
   - **Music Genre Classification**: Classifying a piece of music into multiple genres (e.g., a song can be both "jazz" and "blues").
