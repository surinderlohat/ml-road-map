### 2. Regression

Regression is used when the target variable is continuous. The goal is to predict a continuous value. Some common examples include:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A type of regression that fits a polynomial equation to the data.
- **Ridge Regression**: A linear regression technique that includes regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Lasso Regression**: Similar to ridge regression but can shrink coefficients to zero, thus performing feature selection.
- **Elastic Net Regression**: Combines both ridge and lasso regression regularizations.

#### Examples of Regression Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Neural Networks**

### Other Types of Supervised Learning

While classification and regression are the main types, there are also other specialized forms of supervised learning:

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on previously observed values. It often uses regression techniques but is specialized due to the temporal nature of the data.
- **Sequence Prediction**: Predicting the next item in a sequence, such as text generation or next-step prediction in navigation.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual data points within a dataset, which can be framed as a binary classification problem (normal vs. anomaly).
