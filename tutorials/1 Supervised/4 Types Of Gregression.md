Regression problems involve predicting a continuous output based on one or more input variables. Here are some of the most common types of regression problems:

1. **Linear Regression**: 
   - Predicts a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
   - Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
   - Common applications: predicting house prices, sales forecasting, and predicting salary based on experience.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Used for binary classification problems but can be extended to multiclass classification (though it predicts probabilities, not continuous outcomes).
   - Common applications: spam detection, disease prediction, and customer churn prediction.

3. **Polynomial Regression**:
   - Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to model non-linear relationships.
   - Common applications: modeling growth rates, and predicting outcomes with quadratic or cubic trends.

4. **Ridge Regression**:
   - A type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting.
   - Useful when there are many predictors, or the predictors are highly correlated.
   - Common applications: any scenario where multicollinearity is present or where overfitting is a concern.

5. **Lasso Regression**:
   - Similar to ridge regression but uses L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection.
   - Common applications: feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, and scenarios with potential multicollinearity.

6. **Elastic Net Regression**:
   - Combines the properties of ridge and lasso regression by using both L1 and L2 regularization.
   - Common applications: scenarios that require both regularization and feature selection.

7. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:
   - Uses support vector machines to perform regression tasks.
   - Finds a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that fits the data within a specified margin of tolerance.
   - Common applications: stock price prediction, and time series forecasting.

8. **Decision Tree Regression**:
   - Uses decision trees to model the relationship between input features and continuous target variables.
   - Common applications: scenarios with non-linear relationships and complex interactions between variables.

9. **Random Forest Regression**:
   - An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
   - Common applications: predicting house prices, and any task where overfitting and high variance need to be mitigated.

10. **Gradient Boosting Regression**:
    - An ensemble technique that builds multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially to minimize the prediction error.
    - Common applications: competitive machine learning tasks, and scenarios requiring high predictive accuracy.

11. **Neural Network Regression**:
    - Uses neural networks to model complex relationships between inputs and continuous outputs.
    - Common applications: image processing tasks requiring regression, such as predicting the coordinates of objects in an image.

These regression types cater to various problem characteristics, such as the nature of the relationship between variables, the complexity of the data, and the need for regularization or feature selection.
