# Classification Types in Machine Learning

Classification in machine learning involves predicting a target variable that is categorical. There are several types of classification problems based on the nature of the target variable and specific requirements. This repository provides an overview of common classification types.

## Types of Classification

### 1. Binary Classification
**Description**: Classification where the target variable has two classes.  
**Examples**:
- Spam detection (spam or not spam)
- Disease prediction (disease or no disease)

### 2. Multi-class Classification
**Description**: Classification where the target variable has more than two classes.  
**Examples**:
- Handwritten digit recognition (digits 0-9)
- Animal species classification

### 3. Multi-label Classification
**Description**: Classification where each instance can belong to multiple classes simultaneously.  
**Examples**:
- Text classification where a document can belong to multiple topics
- Image tagging

### 4. Imbalanced Classification
**Description**: Classification where the classes are imbalanced, i.e., some classes have significantly more instances than others.  
**Examples**:
- Fraud detection
- Rare disease prediction

### 5. Ordinal Classification
**Description**: Classification where the target variable has ordered categories.  
**Examples**:
- Movie ratings (poor, average, good, excellent)
- Education levels (high school, bachelor's, master's, PhD)
